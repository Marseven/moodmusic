## v3.0.8 Possible Breaking Change

Out of the box the system no longer comes with a service pre-configured. Which will cause an error for those who did **NOT** previously publish the configurtion file. Follow the [getting started guide](https://lyften.com/projects/laravel-geoip/doc/) on how to publish the config and how to set up a service. 

Sorry for this inconvenience, but MaxMind made me remove the free service that was the default. If the config file was published prior to this change, you should not been affected.
